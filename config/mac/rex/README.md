# Rex on macOS

## Ownership and activation

- `packages/rex-release.json` pins the official preview DMG by version, build, URL, and SHA-256. `dotfile update` refreshes it through the shared pin updater, requiring matching repeated downloads. The package build verifies the app's Apple signature and Superlogical team ID, and validates `init.lua` with the bundled CLI.
- Home Manager installs the app in `~/Applications/Home Manager Apps/` and exposes `rex` in PATH. Inside Rex, `REX_BIN_DIR` takes precedence so the CLI matches that server.
- `config/darwin.nix` owns native font preferences and disables Sparkle's automatic checks/installs. Upgrades and rollback use Nix generations, not the in-app updater. A pin change does not upgrade a running process.
- Only `~/.config/rex/init.lua` and `Catppuccin Macchiato.conf` are linked. Other Rex state, sessions, permissions, and settings remain native. Existing config conflicts are not forcibly overwritten; save and reconcile your file before activating.

Run `dotfile packages`, then open `~/Applications/Home Manager Apps/Rex Beta.app`. Do not run it beside the older `/Applications` copy expecting a separate server: both use Rex's native account state. Save work and close the old sessions/app yourself before switching; provisioning does not terminate them.

For an already running app, `rex config check` validates the linked file and `rex config reload` applies its shortcuts without restarting terminals. Reload is explicit, not an activation side effect.

## Ghostty appearance

The native font preferences retain **FiraCode Nerd Font** and the existing Noto/symbol/emoji fallback list. macOS uses installed fallback faces; unavailable families fall back to the system. Nix already supplies the primary FiraCode Nerd Font.

Press **Ctrl+B, Shift+T** to import the supplied **Catppuccin Macchiato** Ghostty theme, then select it in Rex's theme picker (**Change Theme…** in the command palette). This preserves its ANSI palette, background, foreground, cursor, selection, and split-divider colors. Theme selection remains a native preference so later user choices are not overwritten.

## tmux-style shortcuts

Keep Rex's native Cmd shortcuts, plus these sequences (press Ctrl+B, release, then the next key):

| Following key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `c` | New tab |
| `p` / `n`, Ctrl+P / Ctrl+N | Previous / next tab |
| `1`–`9` | Go to tab (Rex numbers from 1) |
| `h` / `j` / `k` / `l` (also with Ctrl) | Focus left / down / up / right pane |
| `H` / `J` / `K` / `L` | Resize in that direction by 5% |
| `\|` or `%` | Split right |
| `-` or `"` | Split down |
| `<` / `>` | Move tab backward / forward |
| `z` | Zoom pane |
| `s` | Session picker |
| `R` | Reload Rex config |
| Ctrl+B | Send literal Ctrl+B to the terminal |
| `T` | Import the managed Catppuccin theme |

Splits and tabs use Rex's native current-directory behavior. Copy/paste use native **Cmd+C / Cmd+V**; Ctrl+C still interrupts the foreground program.

`debt:` Rex's exposed actions do not cover Ghostty's conditional Ctrl+C copy, tmux's vi copy mode, last-used tab, full-width splits, repeat-key resizing, or the custom user/host/date status line. Resize units are percentages rather than cells, and Rex manages scrollback itself. The migration ceiling is the documented Lua API plus actions exposed by the pinned client; add parity only when upstream exposes those capabilities. Ghostty's scroll multiplier and delayed quit have no managed Rex equivalent.

`debt:` Lua config does not expose persistent font/theme defaults. Fonts use the pinned app's native preference keys; the theme requires one native import/selection. Replace these with a declarative appearance API when Rex publishes one. Font application and GUI theme import require a manual check after activation; config validation alone does not establish appearance parity.

## Agents and status tracking

Activation runs the pinned CLI's **`rex skill setup --agent pi`**, without `--force`. Rex owns the dynamic guide in `~/.agents/skills/rex`; a foreign skill is preserved. It calls the installed `rex skill show`, so instructions follow the installed version. Pi and other harnesses reading this shared directory can discover it. This is not a copied/vendored custom skill, and no Codex/Claude hook files are edited.

The pinned Pi already implements Rex's **Program Status Protocol (OSC 7501)** natively: working, blocked (dialogs/login), done, error, and idle. Detection is automatic inside Rex. No extension, title scraping, polling daemon, or extra `PI_PROGRAM_STATUS` override is needed. Reports contain status/session labels, not prompts or model output. Start a fresh Pi session inside Rex to discover the skill.

Check locally:

```sh
rex version
rex config check
rex skill status --json
rex skill show
```

To inspect a specifically identified agent pane without reading its screen/history:

```sh
rex --autostart=false --timeout 5s do -b "$REX_BLOCK" \
  com.superlogical.terminal.program_status --json
```

Use full session/pane IDs from the intended Rex context; do not inspect unrelated panes or restart a server to make status checks pass.
